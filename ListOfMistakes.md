1) WRONG AREA OF FOCUS please just bother to look and count edge moves dun lazy
2) its okay to give up c moves?
3) Opponent 2 piece flip is not a viable move for them please check properlyyyy
4) Dont play unfavourable/ugly edge moves if u have nicer moves to play
5) Really need to pay more attention to good moves for the opponent on the edges




# Core - you better have a good fucking reason to violate these
1) 1 outer piece flip
2) 1 direction flip

## Top Priorities - these do not take precedence over core
1) Opponent good move
2) playing moves before they become difficult to play
3) Odd spaces that you should jump first
4) aiming for holes in the position (giving up one move  to aim and get another is good)
5) Inner 16 > Middle Edge > Edge
6) 
## edges
1) no of moves >> shape 
2) a > b generally
3) dont be scared to hit a if the feed also flips the inner a 
4) ** i needa work on this shit its okay to take edges if good instead of letting them hit more times **.
5) Check adjacent edges before hitting inneredge/edge
6) hitting inner a on top of opponent a is generally bad? 


## Bad habits
1) if opponent cannot play there please dont waste time playing there (2 piece flips are basically unplayable please)
**PLEASE** MY GOD
2) Be mindful of stones you return and unpoisoning
3) your goal is not to not break, its to break at a good timing.
3) your goal is not to not break, its to break at a good timing.
3) your goal is not to not break, its to break at a good timing.


## General Tips
When leaving an opening to target another spot, just because opponent dosent have access dosent mean its good try to think what happens when they try to get access

Inner edge moves when opponent already has the edge are low prio becuz after u play opponent still got one move on edge so just go do smth else lol.

Taking away opponent good move at the expense of 2 of yours is bad

you might want to save a good move for later becuz...
Just because when they play it opens up a new for you : 1 for 1
It is still better if you can play first and then they cant play that move 1 for 0
basically if u want to save moves think about this ya


also jesus christ if you can use the inneredge opponent stone to hit the edge vs hit the inside just hit the ddge becuz if you hit the inside you effectively chop 2 moves with 1 lol

breaking to inner edge is bad if you still have 2 or more moves on adjacent inner edges and any other move will wipe them all
break inner edge in a manner wherer you can continue
dont need to touch places where opponent will flip 2 outer pieces just let him fk himself
when opponent plays to a edge checkwhat move opens up on adjacent edges because he poisons his own response.


## General Flow

1) dont use brain and play opening
2) check for opponents moves and eliminate if possible
3) when breaking to inner edge/edge, break in a manner that can continue and also count the variations that open up because you poison your own response
4) try not to break to inner edge when you still have 2 moves on adjacent inner edge becuz it fucks you if you eliminate them both simultaenously
5) when opponent breaks to edge/inner edge check what moves have opened up as a result edge when you still have 2 moves on adjacent inner edge becuz it fucks you if you eliminate them both simultaenously
6) conversely when playing on edges/inner edges be mindful of what moves you open up because you poison your response. 



brain damage is real pls send help
