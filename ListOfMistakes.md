1) WRONG AREA OF FOCUS please just bother to look and count edge moves dun lazy
2) its okay to give up c moves?
3) Opponent 2 piece flip is not a viable move for them please check properlyyyy
4) Dont play unfavourable/ugly edge moves if u have nicer moves to play
5) Really need to pay more attention to good moves for the opponent on the edges




# Core - you better have a good fucking reason to violate these
1) 1 outer piece flip
2) 1 direction flip

## Top Priorities - these do not take precedence over core
1) Opponent good move
2) playing moves before they become difficult to play
3) Odd spaces that you should jump first
4) aiming for holes in the position
5) Inner 16 > Middle Edge > Edge
6) 
## edges
1) no of moves >> shape 
2) a > b generally
3) dont be scared to hit a if the feed also flips the inner a 
4) ** i needa work on this shit its okay to take edges if good instead of letting them hit more times **.
5) Check adjacent edges before hitting inneredge/edge


## Bad habits
1) if opponent cannot play there please dont waste time playing there
**PLEASE** MY GOD
2) Be mindful of stones you return and unpoisoning
