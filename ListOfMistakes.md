1) WRONG AREA OF FOCUS please just bother to look and count edge moves dun lazy
2) its okay to give up c moves?
3) Opponent 2 piece flip is not a viable move for them please check properlyyyy
4) Dont play unfavourable/ugly edge moves if u have nicer moves to play
5) Really need to pay more attention to good moves for the opponent on the edges




# Core - you better have a good fucking reason to violate these
1) 1 outer piece flip
2) 1 direction flip

## Top Priorities - these do not take precedence over core
1) Opponent good move
2) playing moves before they become difficult to play
3) Odd spaces that you should jump first
4) aiming for holes in the position (giving up one move  to aim and get another is good)
5) Inner 16 > Middle Edge > Edge
6) 
## edges
1) no of moves >> shape 
2) a > b generally
3) dont be scared to hit a if the feed also flips the inner a 
4) ** i needa work on this shit its okay to take edges if good instead of letting them hit more times **.
5) Check adjacent edges before hitting inneredge/edge
6) hitting inner a on top of opponent a is generally bad? 


## Bad habits
1) if opponent cannot play there please dont waste time playing there (2 piece flips are basically unplayable please)
**PLEASE** MY GOD
2) Be mindful of stones you return and unpoisoning
3) your goal is not to not break, its to break at a good timing.
3) your goal is not to not break, its to break at a good timing.
3) your goal is not to not break, its to break at a good timing.


## General Tips
When leaving an opening to target another spot, just because opponent dosent have access dosent mean its good try to think what happens when they try to get access

Inner edge moves when opponent already has the edge are low prio becuz after u play opponent still got one move on edge so just go do smth else lol.

Taking away opponent good move at the expense of 2 of yours is bad

you might want to save a good move for later becuz...
Just because when they play it opens up a new for you : 1 for 1
It is still better if you can play first and then they cant play that move 1 for 0
basically if u want to save moves think about this ya


also jesus christ if you can use the inneredge opponent stone to hit the edge vs hit the inside just hit the ddge becuz if you hit the inside you effectively chop 2 moves with 1 lol

breaking to inner edge is bad if you still have 2 or more moves on adjacent inner edges and any other move will wipe them all
break inner edge in a manner wherer you can continue
dont need to touch places where opponent will flip 2 outer pieces just let him fk himself
when opponent plays to a edge checkwhat move opens up on adjacent edges because he poisons his own response.

middle a sucks becuz they tend to block each other if u need one middle a for another sequence dont play the first one.
make use of opponent on c to attack
middle edge playing into squares where the opponent has a hard time responding

## General Flow

1) dont use brain and play opening
2) check for opponents moves and eliminate if possible
3) when breaking to inner edge/edge, break in a manner that can continue and also count the variations that open up because you poison your own response
4) try not to break to inner edge when you still have 2 moves on adjacent inner edge becuz it fucks you if you eliminate them both simultaenously
5) when opponent breaks to edge/inner edge check what moves have opened up as a result edge when you still have 2 moves on adjacent inner edge becuz it fucks you if you eliminate them both simultaenously
6) conversely when playing on edges/inner edges be mindful of what moves you open up because you poison your response. 
7) last box is a real thing 

if u have to open 2 opening where its already bad for opponent to play is ok

pre condition to taking the edge is that the response is bad... duh but also no duh
bad meaning opens 2 spaces or 2 directions.

brain damage is real pls send help

middle game think in terms of areas.

## WHen playing one space away

WHen u play one space away and u make a hole u cant access it sucks

## where did i go wrong i lost a friend
if he has a quiet feed but u can play one away first u should - play before it gets difficult to play. 

why are u so trigger happyyy - okay to play quiet moves if it forces him to open somewhere else for you to play.

stacking on top of their a is so ufcking bad its unbelievable.
i refuse to do this anymore now
landing is also good if opponent one away makes hole they cannot access
dont need to cover all their moves only need to cover their **quiet** moves. Imagine covering moves that you dont need to and giving them good opion
bad habit covering one good move but opening up another one or even more.
STOP PLAYING ONE AWAY AND COVER HIS GOOD EDGE MOVES OHMYFUCKINGGOD


when to play the diagonal a from the double inner b?: need to find out
theres this reoccuring theme where just because he play u can play something back dosent mean you cant play his move first, let him play something back and then play a third counter move
rationale is 2-1 is better than 1-1
check this when looking at pairs
